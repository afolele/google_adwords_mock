                  or coordinate signups for an upcoming race.

              <p>
                With Google Trends, people can track interest in green search queries over time
                since 2004, and potentially use this information to inform decisions. For instance,
                those interested in purchasing an alternative fuel vehicle will find that interest
                in <a href=
                "/trends/explore#cat=0-47&amp;q=%22flex%20fuel%22&amp;cmpt=q"
                target="_blank">flex fuel</a> has declined since peaking in 2006 and 2008, in

                "_blank">ev charging</a>, which have climbed steadily in recent years. By hovering
                over the letters in the graph, they can find relevant news articles related to
                spikes and dips. Groups can also use the tool to gain information to move their
                environmental agendas forward. For example, community members can point to the
                growing momentum of <a href=
                "/trends/explore#q=%22urban%20farming%22&amp;cmpt=q" target=
                "_blank">urban farming</a> when advocating for zoning and legislation changes that
                support growing their own food. Similarly, seasonal patterns (as seen in searches

                “rising” searches. The “Forecast” feature can be especially helpful to businesses
                in green markets. For instance, a developer may try to predict the demand for

                its archives from the data center, thereby reducing our carbon footprint by 73
                metric tons of carbon dioxide per year. Also, as the company grows, it won’t have
                to add infrastructure to either the main data center or the disaster recovery site.

              </h3>
              <p>
                Using Gmail is more energy efficient than using email hosted on local servers (such
                as on a server in your office or room). This is because Gmail is hosted in the
                cloud, which is large, so it can more efficiently distribute resources among many
                users. If you're interested in more detail, <a href=
                "http:/green/pdfs/google-green-computing.pdf">here's the math</a>.
              </p>
              <p>
                The study linked above demonstrates significant cost and carbon savings for the
                four million businesses that use Gmail. A business using Gmail decreases the
                environmental impact of their email service by up to 98%. In fact, small businesses
                with less than 50 people can save up to 172.8 kWh of energy and 101.6 kg of carbon
                per user per year by using Gmail instead of locally-hosted email.

              <p>
                For example, a collaboration led by researchers at the University of Maryland has

                  <p>
                    In April 2010, we partnered with the nonprofit <a href=
                    "http://www.cdproject.net" target="_blank">Carbon Disclosure Project</a> (CDP)
                    to include environmental ratings into Google Finance. These ratings evaluate
                    how well a company measures and reports its greenhouse gas emissions. The
                    ratings also measure a company's awareness of the risks and opportunities that
                    climate change poses to its business. The score is listed as “Carbon Disclosure
                    Rating” and appears in the “Key stats and ratios” box on the right side of a
                    company’s Google Finance page.
